            "Hiya, Cat Butler here. 
        I grew up on the sunny south-west coast in Lyme Regis!
        I moved to Birmingham to study in 2013 and have been living and working here for 8 years, 
        flitting from Selly Park and Bearwood."
        </em>
        <br>I am a freelance producer and theatre maker.
        I co-founded my own performance company LYNNEBEC in 2018
        and have been making work in outdoor spaces, festivals and site-specific spaces. 
        Currently developing an educational arts and science project aimed at increasing
        the representation of women in STEM.
