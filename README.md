# Website Challenge

## Overview

For your first project on the bootcamp, we want you to make a website all about your pair partner using HTML and CSS.

The person you are making your website for is your partner, aka The Client. It is your job as a programmer to understand what the client wants from a profile site, assess what information is available and useful, design what serves the audience of users (aka the other bootcampers) best from the experience, and then create something which best solves those needs. You won't be given any guidance of what to build - you'll need to empathise with your users to see what they would find useful (or even survey and talk to them), and plan your site accordingly.

## Outcome

- a single web page created with HTML and CSS
- a profile describing your client
- a short 1-page README.md file alongside it which describes how you went about the project (your thoughts, research, plans, and justification for decisions)

## Extra

This is not only a chance for you to practice the core skills of HTML and CSS, but also a chance to invest time in thinking about how to build a website for a client, and have a user-centric approach - a key learning objective of the course. You will need to actively communicate with the client to find out everything you need in order to design and build a website which represents them to the rest of the cohort.

Although you will each have an individual repository in which to make the website, there is nothing stopping you pair programming with your partner on the project. Organise your time so that you can spend an equal amount of time on each project. For example, if you spend three hours coding together on Sunday, you would spend 1.5 hours pair programming on one site, before moving over to the other site.

This project will span the first two weeks of the bootcamp, and you will be given time in live evening sessions to work on it as well.

**HTML** (Hyper Text Markup Language):   is the standard markup langauge for creating web pages, it consists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display the content such as paragraphs and links etc

**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets):  basically describes how HTML elements are shown on screen, it is stored in a seperate file that is linked with the HTMl file, it used to design the HTML with colour, font size, font type etc.

**Markdown**:                            is a markup language that   is used for formatting text using a plain-text editor, it is commonly used in blogging, instant messaging and read me files

**Website Challenge Review**

I feel that to begin with i was a bit lost on where to begin, so at first i had a research on different profile page templates and ideas came to mind from there.
Following this i then called my partner Catherine, as the page was on her and so i thought the best place to start would be to call her and discuss what we would typically expect to see on a profile page and what she would like to see on the page.
This led to the creation of a profile-page question repository that we then shared between us on github, on that sheet was a list of questions we would like to see on our webpage and so we took turns answering these questions and pushing them back up to each other.
Once we filled this in and got the answers we then had to think about what we wanted the layout of each others page to be etc, and from here we began to write our code.
Now when it came to writing my code i had a research into webpage layouts to decide a basic starting point and from here i was able to design the basic page for my profile page.
Once id done a bit i decided to call my partner and see what she thought of the code i had done and the overall layout, where she suggested possible improvements and font etc
This went back and forth until we both reached a stage where we were happy with it.
